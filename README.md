#  Problem Statement in brief

⦁	An intrusion is somebody (“hacker" or "cracker") attempting to break into or misuse the system. The word "misuse" is broad, and can reflect something severe as stealing confidential data to something minor such as misusing your email system for spam (though for many of us, that is a major issue!). 
With the emergence of Internet and the World Wide Web, the concept of Global village has taken its inception. 


⦁	There are facilities to virtually achieve any kind of information on the internet. All these advantages have been achieved because of networking computers and associated devices. There has been a rapid progress in this field. Along with this, there is the arms race between the intruders and people who provide security to the systems in networks. This project IDS (detection and protection) runs on the host machines and assists the network Administrators to detect several intrusion attacks and inform to the owner of the system and also provide security by blocking the malicious users based on their IP addresses.

⦁	A deliberate attempt to enter a network and break the security of the network and thus breaking the confidentiality of the information present in the systems of the network. 
The person who tries to attempt such an action is called as an Intruder and the action can be termed as Network Intrusion. The network administrator is supposed to protect his network from such persons and this software can help his in his efforts.
