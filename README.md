# An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 

## That is a system responsible for detecting anomalous, 
In-appropriate, or other data that may be considered unauthorized occurring on a network. An IDS captures and inspects all traffic, regardless of whether it’s permitted or not. Based on the contents, at either the IP or application level, an alert is generated. Intrusion detection devices are an integral part of any network. The internet is constantly evolving, and new vulnerabilities and exploits are found regularly. 

“They provide an additional level of protection to detect the presence of an intruder, and help to provide accountability for the attacker’s action”.

#  Problem Statement in brief

⦁	An intrusion is somebody (“hacker" or "cracker") attempting to break into or misuse the system. The word "misuse" is broad, and can reflect something severe as stealing confidential data to something minor such as misusing your email system for spam (though for many of us, that is a major issue!). 
With the emergence of Internet and the World Wide Web, the concept of Global village has taken its inception. 


⦁	There are facilities to virtually achieve any kind of information on the internet. All these advantages have been achieved because of networking computers and associated devices. There has been a rapid progress in this field. Along with this, there is the arms race between the intruders and people who provide security to the systems in networks. This project IDS (detection and protection) runs on the host machines and assists the network Administrators to detect several intrusion attacks and inform to the owner of the system and also provide security by blocking the malicious users based on their IP addresses.

⦁	A deliberate attempt to enter a network and break the security of the network and thus breaking the confidentiality of the information present in the systems of the network. 
The person who tries to attempt such an action is called as an Intruder and the action can be termed as Network Intrusion. The network administrator is supposed to protect his network from such persons and this software can help his in his efforts.

#  1.2 Existing system:
In present systems there is hardly to find security threat embedded in any java codes or system that using java language in their preferred system environment and as per their requirements to be met on existing system, professionally ready this system needs to be use and implemented easily not only at client end also in server / networking equipment’s.  

#  1.3Proposed system:
The proposed system is a Java AWT based application which is available all the time. The system provides details of intrusions detection as well alerting via alerbox window when there is some intruder suspected on network packet this system generated. 

# IDS Overview and Classification 

⦁	Traffic Collector: The component is responsible for gathering activity and event data for analysis. On a host-based ID this will typically include metrics such as inbound and outbound traffic and log and audit file activity recorded by the operating system. A NIDS will analyze the segment of the network by pulling the data off. 
⦁	Analysis Engine - The analysis engine analyzes the data that the traffic collector gathers. In case of a knowledge-based IDS comparison of data is done with a signature database. A behavior based IDS, compares it against normal behavior information gathered over time to see if the current behavior deviates from the norm. 
⦁	 Signature Database - Used in knowledge-based systems, the signature database is an amalgamation of signatures known to be associated with suspicious and malicious activities. A knowledge based IDS is only as good as its database. Like Port Number via Socket 1001, 
⦁	 Alerting and Reporting Interface - A management interface providing a mechanism by which system administrators may manage the system can receive alerts when intrusions are detected.
